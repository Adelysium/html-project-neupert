            <h2>What is Disc Golf?</h2>
            <p class="content">Disc golf is one of the fastest growing sports in the world with over 35,000 new registered players since the start of 2020, but it's also really easy to pick up and very cheap to get started!</p>

            </figure>
            <p class="content">Played like traditional golf, the goal is to get a circular disc (much like a frisbee) into a chain basket (as seen above) in as few of strokes as possible, throwing the disc from a concrete or turf pad and from where it "lies" until it comes to rest there. Like regular golf, or "ball golf" as the disc golf community calls it, there can be penalties assessed based on hazards, out-of-bounds, or personal conduct.</p>
            <p class="content">Instead of a set of clubs and some golf balls, however, disc golf uses a body's natural levers and the discs themselves to fulfill the task of both. Depending on the width of a disc's rim, how large it's diameter is, how concave the edge of the rim is, and many other factors, different individual "molds" of disc can have very different flight patterns. Changing these different options allows a player to have their bag stocked for ANY occasion!</p>

            <h3>What is a Pro Shop?</h3>
            <p class="content">Pro shops are stores dedicated entirely to disc golf! Here at the Carrollton Pro Shop, we aim to be a one-stop shop for everything a disc golfer might need. Located within a mile of one of St. Louis's premiere courses--Carrollton DGC in Bridgeton, MO--we're a convenient stop on the way to and from the course, so local disc golfers can always have the tools they need to score well. We have partnered with many of the top manufacturers like Innova&reg; Disc Golf and Discraft&reg; to ensure we're stocked with all the premium products that our players want.</p>

            <h3>How are WE Different?</h3>
            <p class="content">For those who may not be local, why should you check out what we have when you could order directly from the manufacturers' websites or a large online retailer such as Infinite Discs or OTB? Because the Carrollton Pro Shop cares about growing the sport locally and regularly time and money to local non-profit clubs to increase the disc golf reach in our area. We support initiatives such as getting clubs and courses set-up at schools and being inclusive to the younger generation as well as to the female disc golfers in the St. Louis region. To this end, we also run our own regional tour series, which is expanded upon below.</p>
